Welcome to *Comprehensive Medical & Geriatric Oncology (COGMO)*, the practice of *Dr Andrew Kiberu*

Started in 2016, at COGMO we have provided cancer care to patients from all over southwest Western Australia in partnership with the Comprehensive Cancer centre at St John of God Hospital Bunbury which was funded by the WA Country Health Services.

Dr Kiberu is both a Geriatrician and a Medical Oncologist and has a keen interest in the management of cancer in adult and older patients. He also has a special interest in Gastrointestinal tumours, neuroendocrine tumours, melanoma and lung cancer coupled with extensive clinical and research experience in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer including the use of targeted therapies, chemotherapy and immunotherapies. He works closely with clinicians and allied health professionals in the southwest order to ensure that country patients have access to the best available cancer care in order to maximise their outcomes. In the southwest we have been able to achieve outcomes comparable to those of patients treated in metropolitan Perth.

Dr Kiberu pursues his clinical, teaching and research interests at Fiona stanley hospital (including Kalgoorlie Regional hospital), and spends two days every week consulting at St John of God hospital Bunbury.

Dr Kiberu participates in several Multidisciplinary Team meetings in Bunbury and at Fiona Stanley hospital in Perth, to ensure that Bunbury patients are considered for the very best and appropriate treatments.

Dr Kiberu is accessible to all emergency departments and General practitioners in the South West. In our practice we make sure that our patients receive timely care in a dignfied and respectul care in an environment that is both empathetic and compassionate.
